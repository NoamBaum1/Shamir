The aim of this project is to understand how works Shamir's Secret-Sharing Sheme.
This project was fully created during an internship of 2 weeks and was only implemented for educational reasons


This code can be used with Shamir.py / Shamir.ipynb (which are the same) which is more user-friendly and use inputs to work.
On the other hand Shamir_v2.ipynb can be used as a quicker and more professional way to experiment Shamir's Shemes and use data.txt to work :
    The program will only work if the data is correctly specified like in this exemple :
    (x1;y1)
    (x2;y2)
    (x3;y3)
    ...

Last, the code Gauss_Matrix.py / Gauss_Matrix.ipnb (which are the same) were used as draft to the decode fonction of Shamir's secret-sharing sheme by using a Matrix that solves itself by diagonalization.
It was essential to develop this program before implementing it directly in the main program
